# reqwirejs-tests

The purpose of this repo is to make it easier for me to run the tests for jrburke/requirejs and my fork tkissing/reqwirejs

Simply execute `run.sh` then open http://localhost:3000/reqwirejs/tests/index.html in a browser for the reqwirejs tests
and http://localhost:3000/requirejs/tests/index.html for the requirejs tests
